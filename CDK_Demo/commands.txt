Run all commands using the CloudShell: 
1. Install the latest version of the CDK, and update to the latest version of TypeScript. :
sudo npm install -g aws-cdk
sudo npm update -g typescript

2. Initialize a sample app using a language of our choice - e.g. typescript. :
mkdir myapp
cd myapp
cdk init sample-app --language=typescript

3. Check your files have been successfully created, the following files should be present in your directory: bin  cdk.json  jest.config.js  lib  node_modules  package.json  package-lock.json  README.md  test  tsconfig.json
The file that contains the details of the stack and its constructs is lib/cdk-init-stack.ts. The cdk.json file tells CDK how to execute your app : 
ls

4. Manually compile the app:
npm run build
cdk ls (to check - the name of our app’s directory is the name of the stack)

5. Synthesise a CloudFormation template:
cdk synth

(It stores the template in cdk.out folder)

6. Deploy the stack: 
(Before we deploy we need to run the bootstrap command. This is to provision required resources for CDK before we can deploy CDK apps into an AWS account and Region - an S3 bucket to store files and IAM roles with permission to perform deployments.)

cdk bootstrap 
cdk deploy


7. In the console, check CloudFormation, review our stack - there should be an SQS Queue, and an SNS Topic.
